**NOT FOR PUBLISHING**


## General

The example project located in `example-proj` describes following features of `raml-to-jaxrs` (taken from https://github.com/mulesoft-labs/raml-for-jax-rs/blob/master/raml-to-jaxrs/README.md):

* Generates interfaces from JSON Schema and RAML Types;
* A response object wrapper is created for each resource action in order to guide the implementer in producing only results that are compatible with the RAML definition;
* Custom annotations are generated for HTTP methods that are not part of the core JAX-RS specification;
* Objects defined as RAML 1.0 objects are generated;
* Objects are also generated based on JSON schemas to represent request/response entities;
* This example uses Maven;


## Example project structure

*README.md*: Readme from original example project repo. May be useful to pull some info from it. Can be deleted.

*pom.xml*: Required. I guess it's a java project setup file. Some info regarding its parts can be found in *README.md*.

*src/main/java/server/ricks/RicksImpl.java*: Simple server to run generated JAX-RS project. Code can be demonstrated without it, but it's needed to demonstrate the project working. I guess users could create their own server but for demo purposes I think it may be good to include this one. Maybe its code should be listed after some title like "now let's create a simple server to test generated jax-rs server".

*src/main/java/server/ricks/RicksImpl.java*: Required for server to run. Implements interfaces generated by the tool. This is logic for handling HTTP requests to the server.

*src/main/resources/api.raml*: Required. API definition.

*src/main/resources/includes/rick.json*: Required. JSON Scheme used in the API definition.

*src/main/resources/includes/ricks-library.raml*: Required. RAML Library that defines type used in API definition.

**Generated files (appear after generating jax-rs project):**

*target/generated-sources/raml-to-jaxrs-maven-plugin/example/jsonschema/ResponseDelegate.java*: Looks like a delegate for Response. Is inherited in generated interfaces.

*target/generated-sources/raml-to-jaxrs-maven-plugin/example/jsonschema/Rick.java*: Model generated from RAML Type. Defines setters/getters/etc.

*target/generated-sources/raml-to-jaxrs-maven-plugin/example/jsonschema/Ricks.java*: API interface declaring all the HTTP methods, response classes.


## To run the example:

1. Install Maven
2. In terminal run:

```sh
cd example-proj
mvn install
mvn raml:generate
mvn exec:java
```

3. Now you have a server running at `localhost:9998`


## Demo of the API/server

http GET http://localhost:9998/ricks
http POST http://localhost:9998/ricks slug=c137 name='Rick Sanchez' age:=70 inCouncil:=false
http POST http://localhost:9998/ricks slug=riq name='Riq IV' age:=70 inCouncil:=true
http POST http://localhost:9998/ricks slug=zar name='Zeta Alpha Rick' age:=70 inCouncil:=true
http POST http://localhost:9998/ricks slug=prime name='Rick Prime' age:=60 inCouncil:=true
http GET http://localhost:9998/ricks
http GET http://localhost:9998/ricks/c137
http GET http://localhost:9998/ricks/riq
http GET http://localhost:9998/ricks/zar
http GET http://localhost:9998/ricks/prime

Same data in JSON if needed:

{"slug": "c137", "name": "Rick Sanchez", "age": 70, "inCouncil": false}
{"slug": "riq", "name": "Riq IV", "age": 70, "inCouncil": true}
{"slug": "prime", "name": "Rick Prime", "age": 60, "inCouncil": true}
{"slug": "zar", "name": "Zeta Alpha Rick", "age": 70, "inCouncil": true}


## Things to note

* Request validation does not work. I guess it's not supposed to work and code for it should not be generated by the tool;
* Requesting unexisting urls does not return 404. I guess that's also supposed to be immplemented by the tool users;
* As we discussed, `mvn install` step may be already run by Java IDEs;
* Licences to `StartServer.java` and `RicksImpl.java` are added when running `mvn install` so they can be removed for article purposes;
* Objects are stored in HashMap instead of real db;
